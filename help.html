#Article Types

There are two types of content suitable for this site. Linked articles or blog articles.

Linked articles are short posts linking to your own blog or content published elsewhere, we need the URL, the title and a brief introduction or description.

Articles need to be a certain format and you can see examples here for linked articles and here for the blog articles.

#Submitting Content
There are several ways to submit blog articles

The quickest way to get something published is to open a github account and fork the repo, create a markdown (see http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics)  file and submit a pull request.

The next and slowest way is to email editor@thechels.co.uk with either attaching a text document or sending a plain text email.

#Other Information
All articles need your name and social media link/handle, twitter preferred, but google or Facebook welcome, we just want to credit you correctly and hopefully gain you followers/friends.
