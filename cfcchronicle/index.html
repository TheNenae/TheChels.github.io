<P>Blogger, Tweeter and Chelsea fan. Found at @MartinLi24 and @CFCChronicle.</p>

<P>Started writing in 2011 and have thus far covered the 2011/2012 and 2012/2013 season, both with enormous turbulence but European success.</p>

<P>Also still in school, studying for my A-Levels.</p>

<P>First memory of a Chelsea match dates back to the excruciating Chelsea v. Monaco 2004 Champions League semi final</p>
