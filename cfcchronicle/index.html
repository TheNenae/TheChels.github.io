Blogger, Tweeter, Chelsea fan. Found at @MartinLi24, @CFCChronicle, http://thechelseachronicle.wordpress.com. 

Started writing in 2011 and have thus far covered the 2011/2012 and 2012/2013 season, both with enormous turbulence but European success. 

Also still in school, studying for my A-Levels. 

First memory of a Chelsea match dates back to the excruciating Chelsea v. Monaco 2004 Champions League semi final
