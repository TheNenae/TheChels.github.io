title: Adam Coombes at Notts County

--- 

The former blue Adam Coombes, formerly known as Adam Phillip, was signed by Notts County after a successful trial this week.

The youngster made the county bench for the opening game of the season away at Sheffield United. But an early red card and 3 early second half changes meant Adam would have to wait to make his first appearance for his new club.

County went on to lose 2-1.
