Chelsea Ladies goalkeeper Nicola Davies completed a move to FA WSL side Doncaster Rovers Belles a head of the midnight deadline.

The Welsh international only made two appearances for Chelsea Ladies after joining from Liverpool last March before being called away with the RAF in April.

Davies could now be poised to make her debut against Chelsea Ladies on Sunday, Chelsea remain with two first team keepers in captain Carly Telford and new signing Marie Hourihan.

Jess Myers, Shannon Lynn, Sarah Quantrill and now Davies have all been keepers at the club in the last 12 months to have then moved on.
