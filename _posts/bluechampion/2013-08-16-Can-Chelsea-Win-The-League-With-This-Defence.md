Chelsea conceded 39 goals last season and finished at third in the league. And that made sure that we struggled to finish top four. We scored 75 goals only but we had scored three less when when we won the league title in 04-05. It’s the 39 goals that we conceded last season that made a difference. Even Arsenal conceded only 37. Man Utd conceded more but they scored many more too and they were poor even though they won the title. Don’t want the 2012/13 Man Utd to be a benchmark of any sort...
