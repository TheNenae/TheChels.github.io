TheCellarRoom has removed the WordPress plugin 'ChelseaStats Widget' and the supporting API service (formerly of api.thechels.co.uk) with immediate effect.

The service was a beta release towards the end of last season to monitor usage/demand and performance.

It has been decided that the service was not worthwhile in terms of  development cost over demand.

thanks for your support.
