Leeds United have today confirmed the departure of Ken Bates from their club. Bates was at the club for eight-and-a-half years and has ended his role as president.

The former Chelsea chairmen had a spell of 21 years with the blues between 1982 and 2003 before selling up to Roman Abramovich. Bates famously purchased our club for just one pound   as he took on the clubs' debt.
