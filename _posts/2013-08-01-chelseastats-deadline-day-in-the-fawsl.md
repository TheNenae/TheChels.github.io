It's transfer deadline day in the Women's super league. 

The Blues have already acted quickly to bring in three  new faces as three moved on, the club do look a bit light in midfield with no real replacement for Edda Gardasdottir. 

Will Emma Hayes add to the Ladies squad? 

Who would you like to see at the club?
