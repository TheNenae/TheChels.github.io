The Thechels.me site has soft launched today and aims to bring subscribers (<a href="/atom.xml">RSS</a>) and <a href="http://twitter.com/TheChelsMe"> @TheChelsMe twitter</a> followers 
with the latest from a whole host of Chelsea FC fan blogs.

The site is open source and <a href="/help">open for submissions</a>.

We are still at a beta stage in design and development but please feel free to raise an issue on our github.com/thechels page 
if you spot a bug or error.
