The first 3 games of Chelsea's preseason tour in Asia focused on one thing tactically: Establishing a solid base, to create familiarity with shape and basic positioning. This work was applied in 2 systems, the 4231 against Singha and Malaysia, then a 433 against Indonesia.

In the first two games we saw very little forward movement from the deep midfielders who maintained shape and covered fullbacks runs forwards. There was however a large degree of rotation between the 3 players supporting the striker, and individuals began to thrive, De Bruyne in particular before he suffered an injury.

In the final game in a 433 we saw central midfielders Ramires and Van Ginkel getting forward supported by a holding midfielder. Their dominance of possession and the weakness of the opponents meant the forwards could happily stay forward and Ba was rarely isolated as the lone striker. The team duly scored 8 goals.

With the most basic shapes, concepts and fitness levels established, the next stage would be integration of the Confed Cup players and improved interplay.

One of the striking features of the two games against Inter and AC Milan was the rotating of players positions on the left side, particularly Van Ginkel. He seemlessly dropped into space left by Ashley Cole or Ryan Bertrand, where Oscar (or against Milan) Mata dropped into his vacated central midfield spot.

For the opening goal against Inter Milan, Van Ginkel won the ball at left back and with Hazard and Ashley Cole already occupying defenders further up the pitch on the left hand side, Moses was given a clearer run through the centre before finding Oscar for a great finish.

The opening goal against Milan also came from an overload on the left hand side, as Van Ginkel and Oscar both fanned out wide to the left with Van Ginkel dropping a pass down the line to Oscar who found Hazard crossing inside him into space. Demba Ba provided a useful decoy run to his left and De Bruyne charged into space from deep on the right to wrong foot the goalkeeper with a calm finish.

These goals were a fantastic sign of the teams potential as a quick striking counter-attacking unit, comfortable maintaining a deeper line and inviting pressure before finding space in behind or in front of the oppositions defence.

Defensively Essien helped by playing an anchor role within the double pivot, rarely venturing forward and allowing either Ramires or Van Ginkel to use him as a point of orientation for their movement around the pitch.

Opponents have found it very difficult to get meaningful shots on target when confronted with 2 or 3 Chelsea players (invariably a fullback, central midfielder and backtracking winger) working in unison to reduce options. Much of this is classic Mourinho. As was the reversion to the 433 for the game against Real Madrid.

It was an interesting contrast then to end up with this nascent Mourinho team playing essentially Mourinho's most attacking creation yet in his Real Madrid side virtually unchanged for personnel, shape or purpose under Ancelotti.

Mourinho's Real Madrid system had Ronaldo arriving from wide-deep starting positions into space, functioning almost as an auxiliary striker at the end of developed plays. This was how Ronaldo scored the 3rd and decisive goal against Chelsea last night.

When on the ball Ronaldo didn't provide much of a significant threat until quite late in the game with a lovely pass through to Morata for a goal ruled out for offside. However, he still found plenty of touches in advanced positions as Madrid had long periods of sustained pressure.

Despite having Ronaldo almost always in touch with Chelsea's defenders, Marcelo was also given license to charge forward at will. Mourinho tried to counteract this by playing Lukaku on the right of Chelsea's attack, but he was never found in that position by Chelsea's midfield who struggled to get any support to him.

Chelsea's attacking midfielders were isolated figures with limited counterattacking opportunities, consistently receiving the ball a long way from goal. There was a lot of rotation between players, with Van Ginkel playing a holding position but still given license to get forward, Ramires and Oscar rotating on the right and Hazard and Lampard on the left.

While the concepts were clear in the players minds, the execution wasn't. Chelsea just don't have the same familiarity of playing together that Madrid do.

There was a significant change after the half time interval where Mourinho went back to a 4231, removing Lampard for De Bruyne (& Oscar for Moses). The extra attacker and having the attackers closer together, further up the pitch, pushed Real Madrid's defence back and Chelsea were very close to equalising maintaining their first significant spell of sustained pressure.

The problem then was that neither Van Ginkel or Ramires were given the role of dedicated holding midfielder, which left far too many options for Real Madrid to find space between midfield and attack. This left the sort of space Ronaldo loves and he went on to score the aforementioned 3rd to end the game as a real contest, the next batch of substitutions following shortly after.

Madrid could have scored more as Chelsea overpursued for a 2nd goal and despite Essien providing a more balanced midfield, most cohesion was lost.

This game left no-one in any doubt as to the standard Chelsea have to strive for, but would also provide confirmation that progress was being made. It was competitive and Chelsea could have had a penalty to possibly end the first half at 2-2. But both systems used revealed their contrasting weaknesses. In the 433 the forwards got too easily isolated and the midfield rarely progressed out of their own half. Lukaku didn't get service, but nor was he able to come back to the play and allow others to progress beyond him (something Rooney is particularly good at). The 4231 was far more cohesive as an attacking unit but without a holding midfielder there was far too much space for a top quality counter-attacking unit like Madrid to exploit.

Both systems can improve on both weaknesses. As Mourinho said, he was “pleased with the weaknesses he saw”.
