<h4 id="who">TheChels.me</h4>    
<p>Is a blogging network for Chelsea Fan blogs with user submitted content, run and controlled by TheChels.org group - owners of 
    <a href="http://www.thechels.net">thechels.net</a>, 
    <a href="http://www.thechels.co.uk">thechels.co.uk</a>,
    <a href="http://www.thechels.biz">thechels.biz</a>, and 
    <a href="http://www.thechels.tv">thechels.tv</a>,</p>

<p>Thechels.me was originally intended to be a social network but never really gained enough support or users compared to more traditional sites like twitter and facebook. This site aims to support bloggers and writers by providing an opprtunity to post short form content and links to their own sites to articles already written, we don't publish content automatically and everything has to be submitted by the user, thus guaranteeing opinions and fresh content from real fans you might not otherwise be aware of.</p>
    
<p>As a writer/blogger this offers a great opportunity to get your site some hits or your content published and read by likeminded fans and for the reader it can be seen as a curation of selected content relevant to you, in a quick and simple website that will work on all devices/browsers.</p>    
    
<h4 id="art">Article Types</h4>

<p>There are two types of content suitable for this site. Linked articles or blog articles.</p>

<p>Linked articles are short posts linking to your own blog or content published elsewhere, we need the URL, the title and a brief introduction or description. these can be identifed by the bookmark icon at the start of the title <i class="icon-bookmark"></i> </p>

<p>Articles need to be a certain format and you can see examples here for linked articles and here for the blog articles.</p>

<h4 id="sub">Submitting Content</h4>
    
<p>There are several ways to submit blog articles</p>

<p>The quickest way to get something published is to open a <a href="https://github.com/">github account</a> and <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo">fork the repo</a> which can be found at http://github.com/thechels/thechels.me, then create a <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics">markdown file</a> and <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests">submit a pull request</a></p>

<p>The next and slowest way is to email editor@thechels.co.uk with either attaching a text document or sending a plain text email. Do not send Microsoft Word documents, they are as useful to us as the trophy cabinet at the Emirates. That is the sort of thing an Arsenal fan would do.</p>
<p>the attached document needs to include the information in the <a href="#link">link article</a></p>    
<h4 id="blog"></h4>    

<h6>Example blog article</h6>
<p>A simple blog article requires the following information:</p>

<pre><code>---

layout: post
title: Lukaku stats report
date: 2013-07-11 22:00:00
author: ChelseaStats
handle: twitter.com/ChelseaStats

---

And here is your full text article, we don't want any images, as they can be slow to load and this site is built for mobile devices as well as desktop computers. you can use html if you like.

or just space you content out for paragraphs.

if you are not sure how to code for the web just put in things like &lt;bold&gt;some bold text&lt;/bold&gt; or &lt;link&gt; http://somewebsite.com ~ text displayed &lt;/link&gt; and we'll do the rest.

</code></pre>   
    
<h4 id="link"></h4>    

<h6>Example linked article</h6>
<p>A simple linked article requires the following information, and will not be published without it. The easiest thing to do is copy this into notepad or a text editor of your choice and change
    the details to suit, then email it to us</p>

and here is brief description to really sell what you are writing about. You can use &lt;i&gt;<i>italics</i>&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;b&gt;<b>bold text</b>&lt;/b&gt; and other basic html if you know how. You should really read this, the information is frighteningly good, no wonder Jamie Carragher had to retire.
