<h4 id="who">TheChels.me</h4>    
<p>Is a blogging network for Chelsea Fan blogs with writer submitted content, run and controlled by TheChels.org group - owners of 
    <a href="http://www.thechels.net">thechels.net</a>, <a href="http://www.thechels.co.uk">thechels.co.uk</a>,
    <a href="http://www.thechels.biz">thechels.biz</a> and  <a href="http://www.thechels.tv">thechels.tv</a>.</p>

<p>Thechels.me was originally intended to be a social network but never really gained enough support or users compared to more traditional sites like twitter and facebook.</p>

<p>This site aims to support bloggers and writers by providing an opportunity to post content and links to their own articles on another site</p> 

<p>We don't publish content automatically and everything has to be submitted by the writer guaranteeing fresh news, opinions and thoughts from real fans you might not otherwise be aware of.</p>
    
<p>As a writer/blogger this offers a great opportunity to get your site some hits or your content published and read by likeminded fans.</p>
<p>For the reader, it can be seen as a curation of selected content relevant to you, in a quick and simple website that will work on all devices/browsers.</p>
    
	
<h4 id="art">Article Types</h4>

<p>There are two types of content suitable for this site. Linked articles or blog articles.</p>

<p><i class="icon-bookmark"></i> Linked articles are short posts linking to your content published elsewhere, We need a brief introduction or excerpt to really sell your article. 
This type of content can be identifed by the bookmark icon at the start of the title.</p>

<p>Blog articles contain the full work and is hosted on our website. These articles can vary in length and come without tables, images or videos - If you have media to share then use the link article type.</p>

<p>Articles need to be a certain format and you can see examples <a href="#link">here for linked articles</a> and <a href="#blog">here for the blog articles</a>.</p>



<h4 id="sub">Submitting Content</h4>
    
<p>There are several ways to submit blog articles</p>

<p>The quickest way to get something published is to open a <a href="https://github.com/">github account</a> 
and <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo">fork the repo</a> which can be found 
at <a href="http://github.com/thechels/thechels.github.io">Github.com/TheChels</a>, then create 
a <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics">markdown file</a> in the _posts folder
and then <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests">submit a pull request</a> this sounds 
complicated and is more suited to developers, but long term this makes it very easy for those published regularly.</p>

<p>The next and slowest way is to email editor@thechels.co.uk with either attaching a text document (.md or .txt). 
Do not send Microsoft Word documents, they are as useful to us as the trophy cabinet at the Emirates. 
That is the sort of thing an Arsenal fan would do.</p>

  
<h4 id="blog"></h4>    
<h6 id="exblog">Example blog article</h6>
<p>A blog article requires the following information:</p>

<pre>

handle: twitter.com/ChelseaStats
---

And here is your full text article, we don't want any images, as they can be slow to load and this site is built for mobile devices as well as desktop computers. you can use html if you like. or just space you content out for paragraphs.

If you are not sure how to code for the web just put in things like &lt;bold&gt;some bold text&lt;/bold&gt; or &lt;link&gt; http://somewebsite.com ~ text displayed &lt;/link&gt; and we'll do the rest.

And here is brief description to really sell what you are writing about. You can use &lt;i&gt;<i>italics</i>&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;b&gt;<b>bold text</b>&lt;/b&gt; and other basic html if you know how. You should really read this, the information is frighteningly good, no wonder Jamie Carragher had to retire.
