bio: Was introduced to football in 2006 with the commencement of the FIFA World Cup in Germany and his earliest memory of watching a Chelsea game is when he saw the boys in blue take on Liverpool in the FA Community Shield at Millennium stadium.<br/>
He has been a staunch Chelsea supporter ever since. John Terry and Frank Lampard are his favourite players whilst Jose Mourinho and Carlo Ancelotti his favourite managers, with that historic win in Munich being his favourite Chelsea game.
